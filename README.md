# Static Page Application Specification Standard

This is a standard for files specifying rules for serving content from static files via HTTP(S), as originally formulated in [isaacs/github#408](Initial work at https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/408). More information on the design and reasoning of the standard can be found in the [explainer document](explainer.md).

The working draft for the standard is in the "draft" directory. Right now, files aren't specified in formal, low-level EBNF syntax: they're instead described at the high level, for authors and implementers to understand how to author and implement them, respectively.
