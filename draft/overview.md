# Static Page Application Specification Standard

This is a standard for augmenting a static file tree with files specifying details for serving its content via HTTP, such as routes, redirections, additional headers, and default response bodies.

These commonly-needed features have historically been necessary for all but the most basic and naive site structures, but have also historically only been controllable through implementation-specific configuration directives.

## Terms

### Codebase

The source file tree for a site, before any build or deploy steps are taken. Files that are generated by compilers and server implementations are not part of the codebase.

### Implementation

Any software that reads the files in `_spaspec` and converts it into hosting, either by translating the specifications into a server's configuration format (like `nginx.conf` or `.htaccess`) or by serving files based on its specifications directly (like the reference server implementation).

## Details about the `_spaspec` file tree

See [documentation on the `_spaspec` directory][directory]

## Features

- [Routing specification via `_spaspec/routes`][routes]
- [Default response bodies via `_spaspec/XYY.html` pages][status pages]
- [Custom headers via `_spaspec/headers`][headers]
- [Hostname specification via `_spaspec/hostname`][hostname]

## Prior art
