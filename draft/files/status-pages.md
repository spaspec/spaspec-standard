# HTTP Status Default Bodies

Files of the form `_spaspec/XYY.html`, where `X` is `2`, `3`, `4`, or `5`, and `Y` is any digit, MUST be served by the implementation for responses of that status, when not matching a route with specific content. See the default routes specified in [the documentation for `_spaspec/routes`][routes].
